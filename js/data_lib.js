skills of adults in the United States.1 The survey included a direct assessment of skills and was conducted in 23 countries with nationally representative samples of adults ages 16 through 65.',

with low basic skills.', 'a1a729b5cdddbe92572f9de0fdd33bb4': "The ability to read fluently and for understanding—to be able to learn from text—is perhaps the most important foundational skill for U.S.

revolution has increased the prevalence of and, access to, visual/aural media, written text—whether on paper or screen—continues to be an omnipresent currency of communication and commerce, except for adults who continue to struggle to read.4\nAdults who have trouble reading, using mathematics, solving problems, and using technology are at a disadvantage when competing for jobs in the 21st-century workforce.5 The situation is perhaps most dire for those at the lowest level of reading literacy skills, because limited literacy skill reduces their access to print-based training and educational opportunities that could be used to enhance their social and workforce skills.', 'fa9f1d8c0cb7587fc3a4a467d9935ac8': 'Low literacy adults are not necessarily isolated, thanks to the ever-present

that they could not consistently perform accurately on the easiest literacy tasks on the survey.', '61db5690c1ff919551ba29bff3572d5e': 'One could not estimate what literacy tasks they could do

adults bring to learning programs, because the learning needs of those with very low skill levels may differ from those with more intermediate levels of skills,8 as perhaps best explained in the seminal work of Jean Chall.9 Chall distinguished learning to read—that is, the mastery of decoding, word recognition, and reading fluency—from reading to learn or to do—that is, using text to build one's knowledge or accomplish specific goals.", 'bcf3cd9ab222efc3e720ef0af144e6b6': 'Adults at or below Level 1 have needs at both levels.10 To build fluent, efficient foundational reading skills may require direct knowledge and skill instruction, as well as practice with applying skills to build up fluency of application in literacy contexts at home or in the workplace.11\nThe most elementary applied literacy tasks of the general, cognitive survey (for example, locating a single piece of information in a paragraph of text), while easy relative to the other tasks, are not the most basic,

passages), noncontinuous (such as tables or forms), mixed, or multiple (such as a blog post that contains an initial text and related responses or comments).', '0b2e83325c528d77c0fddc100d50d18e': 'These texts may naturally appear in work-related, personal, social, community, or educational and training contexts.', 'bbbe6097a2d74f6ab30f59e45fd377a2': 'Survey respondents were required to complete tasks that require application of cognitive strategies such as accessing, identifying, integrating, interpreting, evaluating, or reflecting on information in texts.14\nReading components, introduced for the first time in the 2011 PIAAC survey, are part of the literacy assessment framework, but targeted toward adults near the bottom of the proficiency distribution.15 A detailed account of the PIAAC components assessment framework can be found in Sabatini and Bruce,16 as well as in the reading literacy framework.17 The rationale for component skills rests on the premise that the "meaning construction" processes of reading are built upon a foundation of knowledge of how one\'s language is represented in one\'s writing system, that is, component print skills.18 Empirical studies in the reading literature over the past several decades have yielded a rich literature for understanding component reading processes in adults.19 Evidence of an individual\'s level of print skill can be captured in tasks that can be used to provide evidence of a reader\'s ability and efficiency in processing the elements of the written language—letters/characters, words, sentences, and larger, continuous text segments.', '02ed7482cbe5c5f907db2b5c4959e128': 'Reading components are derived from a view of reading literacy skill as a dimension of language proficiency.20 Language learning is typically thought of in four dimensions —reading, writing, speaking, and listening.', 'c33089354c746cdbd01aa6df89b9cb6d': 'For native speakers of languages, foundational speaking and

'ca5d7790b265d5a259ab659766fb09da': 'As native speakers, we can understand what other speakers are saying in "real time," that is, we process meaning at the speed that the speaker is speaking, which is generally in the range of 150 to 175 words per minute for the average adult English speaker.21\nThe challenge, in part, in becoming a fluent, skilled reader, is processing printed text as language written down.', 'f86463de39a0666e627a4f44acd1b508': 'That is, if a reader can recognize the words rapidly, automatically, and with ease, then the meaning of words can be processed seamlessly, using functional areas of the brain devoted to understanding language, that is, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, discourse analysis, and semiotics.22 Proficient reading component competencies in any language are characterized by the ease, speed, and minimal attentional resources required when cognitively processing written text, sometimes referred to as automaticity.23 Skilled readers are not typically aware of the spelling, punctuation, or typography of a text; rather their awareness and cognitive effort is applied toward constructing meaning.', '2f982bdaaa63afd950e34cca8d390f66': 'Thus, an association between reading rate and proficiency is consistently found in studies of adult readers.24\nIndividuals who struggle with reading, on the other hand, expend considerable cognitive effort and attention in translating print into language, which expends cognitive resources that could better be utilized in constructing, interpreting, and evaluating meaning.25 They struggle with learning to map the writing system (i.e., the printed visual symbols individually and in combination) to the spoken form of the language (i.e., the phonetics, phonology, and morphology).26 Their reading behavior is characterized by slow, effortful processing of text.', 'e012247bbc88f2d428e5a62a9f1eb356': 'This can impact not only their recognition of individual words, but also building meaning from sentences and paragraphs of text.27\nThe irregular mapping of sight-to-sound patterns (and vice versa) in English spelling presents an additional challenge to learning to read fluently.28 When the spelling system of a language is highly regular—which means that with a pronunciation guide, the same spelling pattern routinely maps to the same sounds when spoken—then it is referred to as a transparent orthography.29 German, Finnish, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish are examples of languages with relatively transparent spelling systems.', '219b1c95deecec06ede28dec9ed9ce87': 'When sight-to-sound (and vice versa) mappings are less consistent, more learning and practice is demanded before fluency is achieved.30\nThe above account of learning to read focused on native speakers who face the challenge of learning to apply their native language knowledge and skills when processing written texts.', '679e6663a37406b711be6f3cb8743766': 'For nonnative speakers of a language in which

tasks.', '20dc20f1edde8355823f6ea9419cd7a1': 'The findings of this study reinforce the assumption that dyslexics have particular difficulty with the phonological-auditory channel.',
